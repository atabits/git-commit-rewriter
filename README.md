## ⚠️ Important Notes

**⚡️ History rewriting changes commit hashes**

- 💾 Always backup your repository first
- 👥 Coordinate with your team before rewriting shared branches
- 🔒 Use `git push --force-with-lease` to push safely

**🛡️ Built-in Safety**

The app automatically creates backups in `refs/original/` before making changes. You can rollback anytime through the UI!
